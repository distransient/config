# about
This is where I keep my configs for safe keeping. I don't claim a license to anything in this repo, I guess you could say it's in the public domain.

`bashrc` belongs at `~/.bashrc`. `vimrc` can go to `/etc/vimrc` or (depending on distro) `/etc/vim/vimrc` for global use, and to `~/.vimrc` for local use.

## theming
Because I know I'll forget...
My favorite gtk themes are [Numix](http://satya164.deviantart.com/art/Numix-GTK3-theme-360223962) and [Faience](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/GTK3-Gnome-Shell-Faience-255097456). My favorite icon themes are [Nitrux](http://nitrux.weebly.com/products.html) and [Faenza](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228). My favorite cursor theme is [Phoeton](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=142528). I have yet to understand why all my favorite themes have strange names.
