# HECK YEAH

Alright nerds, listen up. These are my system's config files. There are many like it, but these are mine. My configuration is my best friend. It is *my life*. I must master my configuration as I must master my life.

My configuration, without me, is useless. Without my configuration, I am slightly less productive than I am with my configuration. I must configure my configuration. I must configure my configuration more configuratively than my enemy, who is trying to take my job and pull-request away my code. I will.

My configuration and I know what counts in this war is not the code we commit, the abnoxiousness of our presence on IRC channels, nor the free and open source software we run on our computers. We know that it is configuration that counts. We will configurate.

My configuration is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my configuration clean, updated, and well commented, even as I am clean, updated in my fashion, and well make comments outside of others zone of comfort. We will become part of each other, we will.

Before gosh, I swear this creed. My configuration and I are the defenders of my ego. We are the masters of our code. We are the saviors of free and open source software.

So be it, until victory is ours, and there is no proprietary software, but freedom!
